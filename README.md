## Q1: What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?

In TypeScript, interface and type both are used to define the data.

If we use interface while declaring an object, it will be more easier and readable than type.

On the other hand, we can use type to declare variables, functions, arrays, tuples, and even objects. But compared to both of them, they serve almost the same purposes.

There are some differences between type and interface, such as:

- ✅ Interface can be extended.
- ✅ Type can also extend using intersection (`&`) but not ideal for complex extensions.
- ✅ Interface is best for declaring the structure of objects and classes.
- ✅ Type is flexible for union, tuple, and mapped types.
- ✅ Interface is much faster than type in performance.



## Q2: How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

TypeScript improves code quality and project maintainability in different powerful ways, especially when the project is larger.

The most and effective powerful thing is TypeScript can check your data type before it runs — it checks the type at the compile time. In that case, it saves more time and provides error-free code.

While in JavaScript, a type error can only be known when the code runs.

Other benefits of TypeScript:

- ✅ TypeScript has large and easy documentation, which can be understood by everyone.
- ✅ TypeScript improves code scalability, which means we can use TypeScript in our larger projects.
- ✅ It’s easier for team collaboration in larger projects.
